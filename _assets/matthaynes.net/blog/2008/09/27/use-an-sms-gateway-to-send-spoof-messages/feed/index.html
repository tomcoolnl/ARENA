		<description>I received a spoofed text which I later found out was sent through &lt;a href="http://www.hoaxmail.co.uk" rel="nofollow"&gt;hoaxMail&lt;/a&gt;. It was an April Fools prank and I must admit it did make me laugh, however I imagine there are plenty of bad eggs out there that are using it for less innocent means.</description>

		<description>Spranked(dot)com is pure fraud.  Do NOT use this service.  Many times, after purchasing credits, they do not register on your account.  There will also be multiple duplicate charges through PayPal that you did not authorize.  When disputing through PayPal, Spranked's pre-meditated defense is that it's a "Virtual Service" for which there is no recourse.</description>

		<description>Custom senderID is not accepted by USA legislation though american mobile carriers dont allow it.
'Other world' operators are OK. Me personally thinks that SMS spoofing is real fun to do with friends or colleagues..
I use SMSGANG.com, its easy and cheap.</description>

		<description>That's interesting, it's difficult to believe that there is a charge for syndicating sports results but I had heard bad things about PA pricing before so assumed the worst. It's probably worth investigating a bit further.</description>

		<description>I always thought results &#38; things derived from results like league tables were pretty much free, the information is in the public domain &#38; all PA do is collate it. Maybe there's a few different data providers?</description>
