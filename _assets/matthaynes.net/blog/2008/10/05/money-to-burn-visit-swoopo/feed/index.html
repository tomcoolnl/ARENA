		<description>In this awesome design of things you receive  an A for hard work. Exactly where you misplaced everybody ended up being in all the details. As people say, the devil is in the details... And that could not be much more accurate right here. Having said that, allow me inform you what exactly did do the job. The writing is actually really persuasive which is probably the reason why I am taking the effort to opine. I do not really make it a regular habit of doing that. Next, even though I can certainly see the jumps in reason you make, I am not really confident of how you appear to connect your ideas that help to make the final result. For now I will subscribe to your point but wish in the near future you link the facts better.</description>

		<description>I've experienced some problems with Swoopo in the past, and they definitely aren't my top penny auction site to use. I did some searching and I found a review site that discusses Swoopo and other penny auction websites. Here's the url: http://pennyauctionscam.org</description>

		<description>O.k Here is what me carzy(mentally). Everybody who plays(gambles) on Swoopo (atleast in the US and Canda can also use Rockybid.com) Yet there are a lot more users on Swoopo (based on Alexa ratings) when you have almost no chance to win. (rockybid has more than 50% of their items end up under $1. ) So whats the deal is rockybid legit? they do have 500 testimonials, pictures, videos, even gave away a car for $1.24.(Swoopo sold a car too but for like $4,000, I did not bid on that one) Or should I stick my dollars to Swoopo.? (I already played Swoopo, several times and and won one time (Nintendo wii control which I received within 2 weeks for winning; but I did spend about $200) Then again swoopo has more high end items. But again little chance of winning (at least with my strategy). (rockybid has about 6 a day(and another 30 smaller items)) I am willing to invest with a new and better strategy, another $500 of my hard earned money; I am looking for feedback. Do I go to Rockybid or Swoopo! thanks.</description>

		<description>I'm actually new to the whole online shopping concept.  I was looking at a variety of sites out there and have many concerns like most.

After doing some research, I recently stumbled upon this new site, www.BIDZONE.com.  Basic concept, everytime you place a "bid" on an item the product price actually REDUCES rather than increasing.  The price per bid ONLY 50cents and the amount the price reduces 50cents.  This is the first site I've seen do this!!

If anyone else has heard of BidZone - comment below because I'd love to learn more!</description>

		<description>Sites like Swoopo are more for fun than for people actually looking for a bargain. I suggest you look around at the other auction sites similar to Swoopo. Hasteno.com is a new one that I’ve been playing on and I’ve actually won a couple things. Playstation 3 games going for $.08 (2 bids!) and a Nintendo Wii going for $2.16 is ridiculous. Before you completely discount the idea, you should check them out.</description>
