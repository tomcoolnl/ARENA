		<description>The receive function is dying with an "unterminated string literal" on FF3 if there is any input to the socket which contains a ' charachter, which, in my case, everything does! So it is unusable because of that. Is there some way to make it work with strings that have javascript special characters?</description>

		<description>Doesn't work with flash version 10.1.85.3. TCP connection is established to specified host/port, then "" string is sent, and after waits 2 seconds, tcp disconnects. No user data transmitter or received.</description>

		<description>Seems that Symantec is now picking up socket_bridge.swf and reporting it as Downloader.Swif.C Trojan. I've submitted a false positive report, so hopefully it's fixed soon, but in the mean time just a heads up.</description>

		<description>Hmm, that's a weird one I've not seen before. I'm really not that hot with Flash debugging I'm afraid!

I know Ionel who commented above has his own version of the socketBridge app with some revamped code. Basically the same functionality but with a nicer JS interface, might be worth a try if you can't track down the bug.

		<description>Thanks! Moving it off the screen with an absolute position did the trick.

You know, I've been testing this a lot today and sometimes I get the following error for no apparent reason:

Error: Error #1502: A script has executed for longer than the default timeout period of 15 seconds.
	at Boot_3D39A$/__trace()
	at MethodInfo-65()
	at SocketBridge$/connect()
	at Function/http://adobe.com/AS3/2006/builtin::apply()
	at flash.external::ExternalInterface$/_callIn()
	at ()

If you just reload the page, no code changes, it works fine the second time around. Firebug reports the following in these cases:

uncaught exception: Error calling method on NPObject! [plugin exception: Error in Actionscript. Use a try/catch block to find error.].</description>

		<description>@Kaiser Soze

A few options maybe, could try adding CSS display:none; div after the SWF has loaded with SWFObject ? Otherwise you could put it in a div which is absolutely positioned with top and left values of -100000px. 

Sure I have had this working but can't find the exact code I used sorry.</description>

		<description>This is a great tool. I only have one issue: how would you hide it on the page if you don't care to display the console output? I tried several ways to do this (putting the embedded object inside a hidden div, setting the object size to 0x0 or 1x1, etc) but none worked. The swf crashes if I set the size too small, and it doesn't get loaded if I wrap it around an invisible div.

Any feedback on this would be greatly appreciated!</description>
