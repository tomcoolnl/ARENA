		<description>Ah, the backend too out the XML source completly. Too bad. Basically it is the 'manifest' part in the 'content.opf' file in an EPUB.</description>

		<description>This is a very useful task! I am using an Ant build to create EPUB ebooks from source files. One of the task requires me to parse in directory contents into an XML structure. I am not done, yet, I just discovered xml-dir-listing and did a first test run. The end result will be some xml-fragment like this (I hope the formatting does not get hosed):

    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
    

So, as you can see, I will create XML files, each per directory, parse the file elements via XSLT or the XMLTask and inject it into the dynamically created output file. Ideally, as an option, xml-directory-listing would write to the same buffer as XMLTask can read, but I think I am dreaming here ;-) This would make any intermediate files obsolete. But that's just for elegance in a case like this.

Still not sure how to deal with the media-type, though.</description>
