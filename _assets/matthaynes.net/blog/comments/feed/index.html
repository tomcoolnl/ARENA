		<description>My developer is trying to convince me to move to .net from PHP. I have always disliked the idea because of the expenses. But he's tryiong none the less. I've been using WordPress on a variety of websites for about a year and am anxious about switching to another platform. I have heard good things about blogengine.net. Is there a way I can transfer all my wordpress posts into it? Any help would be really appreciated!</description>

		<description>In this awesome design of things you receive  an A for hard work. Exactly where you misplaced everybody ended up being in all the details. As people say, the devil is in the details... And that could not be much more accurate right here. Having said that, allow me inform you what exactly did do the job. The writing is actually really persuasive which is probably the reason why I am taking the effort to opine. I do not really make it a regular habit of doing that. Next, even though I can certainly see the jumps in reason you make, I am not really confident of how you appear to connect your ideas that help to make the final result. For now I will subscribe to your point but wish in the near future you link the facts better.</description>

		<description>The receive function is dying with an "unterminated string literal" on FF3 if there is any input to the socket which contains a ' charachter, which, in my case, everything does! So it is unusable because of that. Is there some way to make it work with strings that have javascript special characters?</description>
